\section{Introduction}
This document describes a simulation study. The study consisted of generating
statistics based on normal random variables and comparing the accuracy of these
statistics to their theoretical expectation.

\section{Methodology}
Consider the normal random variable $X \sim N(-0.5, 2)$. For each simulation
run, $n$ of such variables were randomly generated. Three different $n$ were
used:  $n=50, 100, 200$. For each $n$, 1000 runs were conducted. On each run,
the sample mean and sample variance were computed, as well as their respective standard errors and 95\%
confidence interval. These statistics were averaged over the 1000 runs conducted
for each $n$. The empirical coverage probability also was computed.

\section{Results}
Simulation results are presented in Table 1. The point estimates closely match
the true parameter values. The standard errors of the point estimates decrease
as $n$ increases. The empirical coverage probabilities are very near 95\%.
